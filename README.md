## Project Staffing and Recommendation System
In an IT Industry with huge human resources placed across multiple locations it is very difficult to allocate people with appropriate skill sets to a project. If the skill set is not present within the current location of the project it may need Co-sourcing from another location. The objective is to automate this process to give recommendation on whom to staff in a project within the location further recommend resources from other locations when there is lack of resources.
